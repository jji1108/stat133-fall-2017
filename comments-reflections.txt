Comments and Reflections
1) This was my first time writing unit tests.
2) 4, writing the tests was not very confusing to me.
3) This was my frist time working with ggvis.
4) 2, the syntax of ggvis was very intuitive and similar to that of ggplot.
5) This was my first time working with conditional panels in shiny. 
6) 8, it was quite challenging to work with conditional panels, especially trying to
figure out the elements that go into the conditional panels.
7) I like ggplot the most mainly because that is the package which I had most experience with.
8) My TA, Sidney Le, helped me SO much during this assignment. I wouldn't have
been able to complete this project without him.
9) I spent about 20 hours working to complete this project.
10) The most time-consuming part for me was writing the function and clenaing 
the rawscore by applying the functions to the rawscore data.
